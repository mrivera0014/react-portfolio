I'm from Denver, CO. and worked at Starbucks for about five years. I also have experience with Microsoft Word, Excel, and AutoCAD. I first became interested about coding about two years ago when a friend talked to me about going to school to become a web developer. I decided to look into it more because it seemed very interesting. The more I researched the more I wanted to learn how to code myself. I began to have all these different ideas for projects that I could do if I did decide to take on this challenge. After a few months of planning out how to go about learning coding I decided that this was the right move to make, of course the pandemic happened and delayed my plans a little bit. Today I am going through the University of Denver's coding bootcamp and I am excited to see the progress I make throughout the course."})]})},u=r(22);var b=function(e){return Object(d.jsx)(u.a,{children:Object(d.jsx)("h3",{children:e.children})})},j=r(14);r(36);var g=function(){return Object(d.jsxs)(j.a,{style:{width:"18rem"},children:[Object(d.jsx)(j.a.Img,{variant:"top",src:"/react-portfolio/assets/20191229_205417 (2).jpg"}),Object(d.jsx)(j.a.Body,{children:Object(d.jsx)(j.a.Title,{children:"Junior Web Developer"})})]})};var m=function(){return Object(d.jsx)(d.Fragment,{children:Object(d.jsx)(p,{children:Object(d.jsx)(b,{xs:12,children:Object(d.jsx)(g,{})})})})};r(37);var x=function(e){return Object(d.jsx)(d.Fragment,{children:Object(d.jsx)("div",{className:"project-card",children:Object(d.jsxs)("div",{children:[Object(d.jsx)("img",{className:"projectImg",src:"/react-portfolio"+e.image,alt:e.name}),Object(d.jsxs)("h4",{className:"card-title",children:[e.title," "]}),Object(d.jsxs)("p",{className:"card-text",children:[e.description,Object(d.jsx)("br",{}),Object(d.jsx)("a",{href:e.deployed,children:"Click here to view the deployed application"}),Object(d.jsx)("br",{}),Object(d.jsx)("a",{href:e.deployed,children:"Click here to view the Repository"})]})]})})})},f=r(3);var O=function(){return Object(d.jsxs)(d.Fragment,{children:[Object(d.jsxs)(h.a,{children:[Object(d.jsx)(x,{title:f[0].title,image:f[0].image,description:f[0].description,deployed:f[0].deployed,github:f[0].github}),Object(d.jsx)(x,{title:f[1].title,image:f[1].image,description:f[1].description,deployed:f[1].deployed,github:f[1].github})]}),Object(d.jsxs)(h.a,{children:[Object(d.jsx)(x,{title:f[2].title,image:f[2].image,description:f[2].description,deployed:f[2].deployed,github:f[2].github}),Object(d.jsx)(x,{title:f[3].title,image:f[3].image,description:f[3].description,deployed:f[3].deployed,github:f[3].github})]}),Object(d.jsxs)(h.a,{children:[Object(d.jsx)(x,{title:f[4].title,image:f[4].image,description:f[4].description,deployed:f[4].deployed,github:f[4].github}),Object(d.jsx)(x,{title:f[5].title,image:f[5].image,description:f[5].description,deployed:f[5].deployed,github:f[5].github})]})]})};var v=function(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{children:Object(d.jsx)("h1",{children:"Contact Page"})})};r(38);var y=function(){return Object(d.jsx)(d.Fragment,{children:Object(d.jsx)("img",{className:"resumeImg",src:"/react-portfolioassets/maribel_rivera_resume.png",alt:"Resume"})})};var k=function(){return Object(d.jsx)(d.Fragment,{children:Object(d.jsxs)(h.a,{children:[Object(d.jsx)("h1",{children:"Resume Page"}),Object(d.jsx)(y,{})]})})};r(39);var w=function(){return Object(d.jsx)("div",{children:Object(d.jsx)("footer",{className:"footer",children:" \xa9 2021 Maribel Rivera"})})};var I=function(){return Object(d.jsxs)(s.a,{children:[Object(d.jsx)(l,{}),Object(d.jsx)(n.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",component:m}),Object(d.jsx)(n.a,{exact:!0,path:"/projects",component:O}),Object(d.jsx)(n.a,{exact:!0,path:"/contact",component:v}),Object(d.jsx)(n.a,{exact:!0,path:"/resume",component:k}),Object(d.jsx)(w,{})]})};r(40);c.a.render(Object(d.jsx)(a.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(d.jsx)(I,{})}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[41,1,2]]]);
